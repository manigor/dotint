      <p>Congratulations, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/25/3549970/windows-8-rt-upgrade-update-new-pc">you've installed Windows 8</a>. Now what? Now, you have to figure out how to <i>actually use</i> Microsoft's new operating system before your boss, friends, or family expect you to do something productive. That's just what this guide is for. We'll show you how to find your desktop again, how to change Windows settings, and what those fancy new touchscreen gestures are all about. We'll explain how to do the same things with a mouse and keyboard, in the rather likely event that you aren't using touchscreen hardware.</p>
<p>In other words, we'll show you how to get where you're going in Windows 8, so that you can get back to work.</p>
<h2>Gestures</h2>
<p>Windows 8's primary user interface looks like something you'd see on a smartphone, and it can be controlled like one too. It even has a lock screen, a nice colorful picture with no obvious button to get to where you're going. To dismiss the screen, <b>swipe </b>up. It's the first of many basic gestures you'll learn. <i>Mouse or touchpad: press any key, or click once.</i></p>

<p><q class="left">you'll be greeted by a field of Live Tiles</q></p>
<p>When you make it to the Start Screen, you'll be greeted by a field of Live Tiles, each one corresponding to a software app. <b>Tap </b>any one of them to launch that program, or <b>press and hold</b> to drag the tile anywhere you want. Pretty easy so far, right? If you've already had enough of the new Windows 8 UI and want to get to your familar Desktop, that's a tile you can click as well. <i>Mouse or touchpad: click to launch, or click and drag to move tiles around. Keyboard: <b>Windows + D</b> gets you to the desktop immediately, no matter where you are. </i></p>
<p>On the Start Screen, or inside apps, you can also <b>drag </b>across the screen with a single finger to scroll, or get a zoomed out view of all your Start screen apps by <b>pinching two fingers together</b>. <i>Swipe with two fingers on a touchpad or use a mouse scroll wheel to scroll, and hold down Ctrl and use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.</i></p>

<p>Once you're in a program &mdash; let's say Internet Explorer &mdash; <b>swipe </b><b>down from the top</b> or <b>swipe up from the bottom</b> of the screen to pull up a menu of app-specific commands. In Internet Explorer, you'll see your open website tabs up top, and on the bottom you'll see Back, Forward and Refresh controls flanking the URL bar. <i>With mouse or touchpad, right-click anywhere where it wouldn't activate a different function. With keyboard, <b>Windows + Z.</b></i></p>
<p><b>Drag from the very top to the very bottom</b> of the screen to close an app. <i>Mouse or touchpad: Click and drag instead. Keyboard: <b>Alt + F4</b>.</i></p>
<p><q class="center"><b>Put your mouse cursor in any corner of the screen to simulate gestures</b></q></p>
<p><b>Swipe from the right</b> side of the screen to activate the <b>Charms</b> menu, where you can quickly search or share, send documents to devices (like printers) or access computer settings. <i>Mouse or touchpad: you'll use a <b>hot corner</b> instead: put your cursor in the upper-right or lower-right hand corner for Charms to appear. Keyboard: <b>Windows + C.</b></i></p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b>Tap the Start charm</b>, or press the Windows button on your computer or keyboard, to go back to the Start screen again. <i>Mouse or touchpad: put your cursor in the lower-left hand corner and click.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Multitasking</h2>
<p>If you have a few apps open, <b>swipe from the left edge</b> of the screen to cycle through your previously used apps one at a time. You can swipe repeatedly. <i>Mouse and touchpad: put your cursor in the upper-left hand corner of the screen and tap on the little image that appears. Keyboard: <b>Windows + Tab</b>.</i></p>
<p><br id="1351395929685"><img width="122" style="float: left; padding-right: 10px;" src="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1640587/multi_tasking.jpg" class="photo" alt="Multi_tasking"><b> Swipe away from the left edge, and then towards it again</b>, to pull up the app switcher. <i>Mouse or touchpad: place your cursor in the upper-left corner, then drag it down along the left edge.</i></p>
<p>If you've got multiple apps open, why not view two side by side? <b>Drag an app from the left edge and hold it</b> over the left or right side of the screen to <b>snap</b> a smaller version alongside. Or, <b>drag down from the top of the screen</b>, as if you were going to close an app, then snap it to the left or right. <i>Mouse or touchpad: click and drag from the top-left corner, or right-click on an item in the app switcher.</i></p>
<p><b>Drag the three-dot divider</b> to make the smaller of two visible apps larger, or the larger one smaller. <i>Keyboard: <b>Windows + period key</b>.</i></p>
<p>Where it gets a little tricky is when you're using multiple apps <i>and </i>multiple desktop programs at the same time. The desktop apps won't appear in the app switcher, but if you've got a keyboard handy you can multitask with them, too. Hit <b>Alt-Tab</b> to cycle through both Windows 8 apps and traditional programs.</p>
